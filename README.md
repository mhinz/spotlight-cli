It's also fiendishly easy to add new commands to spot. For adding a command
"music", simply add an executable shell script called "spot-music" to your
$PATH:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# The following line is optional and outputs a small reminder,
# if not enough arguments were given to the "music" command.
required $# '<genre>'

mdfind "kMDItemMusicalGenre == $1"
```

Using this, you can simply list all songs of a certain genre:

```
$ spot music Metal
$ spot music "Alpine folk music"
```

You could also change spot-music to take a second optional argument, to restrict
the matches to a certain directory:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

required $# '<genre>'

genre=$1
dir=$2

mdfind "kMDItemMusicalGenre == $genre" ${dir:+ -onlyin "$dir"}
```

Now, you can also use it like this:

```
$ spot music Metal ~/music
```
